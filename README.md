# 8-Bit Display

A piece of code written by myself as my final project while working towards the PCAP Certification. 

## Description

This piece of code is designed to demonstrate my understanding of Python strings and use. 

Instructions provided for the project: 

Your task is to write a program which is able to simulate the work of a seven-display device, although you're going to use single LEDs instead of segments.

Each digit is constructed from 13 LEDs (some lit, some dark, of course). 

Note: the number 8 shows all the LED lights on.

Your code has to display any non-negative integer number entered by the user.

Tip: using a list containing patterns of all ten digits may be very helpful.

### Dependencies

* Written using Python 3.10
